      - question: L'ordine
        answer: >-
          Puoi ordinare direttamente dal sito, concludi il carrello,
          successivamente ti invieremo una mail per concordare spedizione e
          pagamento per ricevere i tuoi prodotti
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >-
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

            - All discounted items sales are final.
            - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
            - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
      - question: Rapid-fire questions
        answer: >-
          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
